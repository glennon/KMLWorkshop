KML Workshop

This is a workshop--centered around Keyhole Markup Language--put on by Josh Bader and me at [spatial@ucsb] (http://spatial.ucsb.edu) in 2007. Some of the stuff is still useful, so I placed it here so it can be archived (possibly used and eventually updated). I'll place the setup information and supplementary php scripts here as I find them. The randomsphere.php script mentioned in the workshop is in the misc-geo-tools repo: https://github.com/glennon/misc-geo-tools.
